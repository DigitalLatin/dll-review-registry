          a high quality edition that should be regarded by scholars as useful and reliable.
          While lacking certain features that are expected of a full critical edition (such as a
          collation of certain manuscripts, an apparatus fontium), it is free from errors, and
          offers a text that is a genuine improvment over what has hertofore been available.
